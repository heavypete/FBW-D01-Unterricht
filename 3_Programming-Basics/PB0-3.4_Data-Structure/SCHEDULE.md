# PB0-3.4 - Data Structure (7 days)

## Overview

tools to structure, iterate, and change data with JavaScript

## 	Objectives

- Compare between primitive and referential Data Types in terms of their relation to the computer’s memory
	- `a = b` (copy of value?) // string, number, boolean
	- `a = b` (copy of pointer?) // object, array
- Create, access, manipulate and convert between arrays and objects in JavaScript
	- `[]`
	- `{}`
- Use higher order array methods in order to manipulate arrays in JavaScript: 
	- `map()`, `reduce()`, `filter()`, `find()`, `forEach()`, `sort()`
