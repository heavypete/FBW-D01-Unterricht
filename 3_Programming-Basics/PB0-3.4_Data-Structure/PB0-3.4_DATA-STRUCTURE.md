**THIS SUB-MODULE IS BEING DEVELOPED AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE CONSIDERABLY, EXERCISES ARE NOT YET LIVE!**

## Overview

tools to structure, iterate, and change data with JavaScript

## Objectives

- Compare between primitive and referential Data Types in terms of their relation to the computerâ€™s memory
  - `a = b` (copy of value?) // strings, numbers, booleans
  - `a = b` (copy of pointer?) // objects, arrays
- Create, access, manipulate and convert between arrays and objects in JavaScript
  - `[]`
  - `{}`
- Use higher order array methods in order to manipulate arrays in JavaScript:
  - `map()`, `reduce()`, `filter()`, `find()`, `forEach()`, `sort()`

## DAY 1

### Objects: Saving multiple variables in one namespace

- object and properties
  - looks like JSON?
  - how do objects differ from JSON?
- create objects
- add properties
- add methods
- `this` keyword
- accessing properties

### Live Coding

- `01-objects.js`

### Exercises

- https://github.com/FbW-D01/Exercise-110-PB-datastructure-objectscope - (15 questions, build and manipulate objects, methods, keys, values, etc.)

## DAY 2

"Object Scope:

- Methods definition: ""Methods are properties with function values""
- Using methods: Review of used methods so far
- Creating methods
- Object literal context: methods, `this` and `Function.prototype.bind()`"

### Exercises

- https://github.com/FbW-D01/Exercise-111-PB-objects-pt1 - (7 questions, loop through keys and values)

## DAY 3

"Conversion and iterations:

- Iterating over objects: `for(let <property name> in <object name>){ ... }`
- Property names to array: `Object.keys(<object>)`
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-object-methods-in-javascript
  - https://medium.com/youstart-labs/javascript-object-methods-every-developer-should-know-c68c132a658
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmicKaGcs5g
- Iterating over arrays: `for(let <value name> of <array name>){ ... }`
- Accessing properties with bracket notation (w. vars)
- Property values to array: `Object.values(<object>)`"
- The type of an array: arrays are specific objects, `Array.isArray()`

### Exercises

- https://github.com/FbW-D01/Exercise-112-PB-objects-pt2 - (7 questions, loop through, find if in range, find and edit properties)
- https://github.com/FbW-D01/Exercise-113-PB-data-structure-object-exercise - (2 questions, create objects, iterate through)

## DAY 4

"Clones vs. References:

- Simple values are always clones: String, Number, Boolean
  - https://javascript.info/object-copy#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20fundamental%20differences,%E2%80%9Cas%20a%20whole%20value%E2%80%9D.
- Objects are references by default: Array and object literals
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hBJz2PPIVE
- Shallow cloning objects and arrays: the spread operator `...`
- Deep cloning objects and arrays: recursive function"
  - https://medium.com/irrelevant-code/javascript-deep-cloning-and-value-vs-reference-5bf09bf980d6

### Exercises

- https://github.com/FbW-D01/Exercise-114-PB-datastructure-spread - (6 questions, copy, clone, merge arrays)

## DAY 5

"Destructuring:

- Extracting values from arrays: Array destructuring assignment
- Extracting values from objects: Object destructuring assignment
- Named function parameters with object destructuring" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIq3qLaHCIs destructuring
  "Nesting arrays and objects:
- Nesting and accessing arrays within each other
- Nesting and accessing objects in objects
- Reading a program VIII (the property chain)
- Nesting and accessing arrays in objects
- Nesting and iterating over objects in arrays"

### Exercises

- https://github.com/FbW-D01/Exercise-115-PB-datastructure-destructuring - (3 questions, array and object destructuring)
- https://github.com/FbW-D01/Exercise-116-PB-datastructure-nesting - (3 questions, nested arrays and objects)
- https://github.com/FbW-D01/Exercise-117-PB-arrays-nested-loops - (3 questions, output nested arrays)

## DAY 6

### Advanced Array methods:

- Iterating over arrays: `Array.prototype.forEach(<function>)`
  - https://dev.to/shrihankp/higher-order-array-methods-in-javascript-14e7
- Converting an array to a different array: `Array.prototype.map(<function>)`
- Converting an array to a single value: `Array.prototype.reduce(<function>)`
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRgD1yVwIvE
- Getting a subset of an array: `Array.prototype.filter(<function>)`"
