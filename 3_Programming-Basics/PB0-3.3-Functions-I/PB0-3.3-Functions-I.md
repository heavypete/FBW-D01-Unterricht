# PB0-3.3 - Functions-I

## Duration

- Four days:
  - Day 1: Tuesday, June 15, 2021
  - Day 2: Wednesday, June 16, 2021
  - Day 3: Thursday, June 17, 2021
  - Day 4: Monday, June 21, 2021

## Overview

Functions are the building blocks of applications.

## Objectives

- Identify when a function is being used with and without arguments
  - with: `function getCustomer(id)`
  - without: `function getStatus()`
- Declare functions in JavaScript and explain when functions should be created
  - functions do one thing
  - use functions to execute repeated tasks
- Understand how a program with functions is read by a computer and explain the term call stack
  - When you execute a script, the JavaScript engine creates a Global Execution Context and pushes it on top of the call stack. Each time you call a function, it gets pushed to the top of the stack. After it is executed, it gets popped off the stack.

- Differentiate between function arguments and function parameters
  - Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.
  - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp
- Understand the definition of side effects, and compare between functions with side effects and pure functions
  - A function has a side effect when it manipulates state, interacts with the I/O, database, log systems APIs and anything else that effects something external to the function.
  - Side effects aren’t a bad thing, but when hidden, or not otherwise obvious what’s happening, they can be dangerous.
  - Functional programming goes someway towards reducing the impact of side effects in code that follows an imperative paradigm.
  - In order for a function or expression to have a side effect, the state it modifies should be out of its local scope.
  - The lack of side effects makes it easier to do formal verifications, and tends to lean towards an easier method of testing.
  - The problem with shared state is by virtue its shared nature; you need to know the history of the object, shared events and other potential points of mutation and interaction.

- Understand the definition of recursive functions and their uses
  - A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it doesn't. It always has a condition that stops the function from calling itself.
  - Recursion is appropriate whenever a problem can be solved by dividing it into sub-problems.
  - Real-world examples of recursive functions:
    - finding all the files under a directory on a file system
    - "walking over XML" or "walking over HTML", i.e. going as deep as nested elements will go
    - computer compilers and interpreter inherently use recursive themselves: in any language you can have if statements and functions as deep as you can go

## Day 1

### Introduction: Routines and Subroutines (functions)

- early computing: routines
- BASIC sub-routines
- VBA: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/concepts/getting-started/calling-sub-and-function-procedures
- today we use functions
- (in classes, functions are called methods)
- slides: functions.pdf

### Review of functions called so far

- `console.log()`
- `parseInt()`
- what are other functions we have used?

### The call stack

- main concept: functions are put on the stack when they are called and popped off the stack when they are finished
- you see the call stack in [errors](https://www.google.com/search?q=call+stack+error+javascript&sxsrf=ALeKk03O9v9zwJSFq173xA_0o_M00a86tA:1623725202432&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiT_Zzfz5jxAhVJ4OAKHeKcC1wQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1920&bih=937) (images)
- good article: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-call-stack

### Function arguments

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments
- example: arguments.js
- arguments vs. parameters

### Three ways to declare a function

- function declaration:
  `function <name>(<parameters>){ ... }`
- function declaration with value:
  `const <function name> = function(<parameters>){ ... }`
- arrow shorthand:
  `const <function name> = (<parameters>) => { ... }`"

## Day 2

### Parameter scope

- parameterScope.js
- parameterScope.html
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41860464/function-parameter-scope-in-javascript

### Lexical scope, block scope, function scope

- ?Reserved Words? = predefined words in a language or library. Perhaps other frameworks, too.

- **Lexical scope** in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration. But the opposite is not true; the variables defined inside a function will not be accessible outside that function.
- **Block scope** is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.
- **Function scope** means that a variable is accessible inside of the function, but inaccessible outside.
- file: `lexicalBlockFunctionScope.js`
- What we learn from this:
  - Always use const and var for JavaScript programming sanity.
  - If you encounter code that uses var (or doesn't even use var and has no 'use strict'), then refactor it!

### Global vs. local scope: variable reassignment in functions

- file: `localGlobalFunctionScope.js`

### Function declarations can be used anywhere, function expressions can only be used after they are declared

- file: `04-declarationVsExpression.html`
- file: `functionsWhenUsable.js`

  - "If the function uses this from the enclosing function, the arrow function is a good solution. When the callback function has one short statement, the arrow function is a good option too, because it creates short and light code."
  - "For a shorter syntax when declaring methods on object literals, the shorthand method declaration is preferable."
  - "`new Function` way to declare functions normally should not be used. Mainly because it opens potential security risks, doesn’t allow code auto-complete in editors and loses the engine optimizations."
- https://www.sitepoint.com/demystifying-javascript-variable-scope-hoisting
  - "In JavaScript, variables with the same name can be specified at multiple layers of nested scope. In such a situation, local variables gain priority over global variables. If you declare a local variable and a global variable with the same name, the local variable will take precedence when you use it inside a function or block. This type of behavior is called shadowing. Simply put, the inner variable shadows the outer."
